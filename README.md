Hii! My name is Gabriella I'm a 14 year old girl from Kenya! I'm an SDG Champion, Championing SDG 9, 14, and 15. And I really Love Animals!

My Project is a website called Aviation Mission The webiste is to help Teens/Children learn about aviation without getting bored..cause well am guessing not every child wants to sit in a class and hear a boring topic about it.

I love airplanes and would love to use it to my advantage cause omg..I love love lovee animals and sometimes humans cant go places planes and drones can so I was to make a diffrence.

I made my Project with HTML, CSS, Java Script and lots of testing and inspo!

I still had challenges with JS but I have learned alot like you can add more than one html and css. I also believed in myself that I can do things I never would have thought I could!
